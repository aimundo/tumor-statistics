An rm-ANOVA can be defined as:

$y_{ijt}=\delta_{j}+\gamma_{j}+\tau_{t}+(\gamma \times \tau)_{jt}+\varepsilon_{ijt},$

where the response $y$ of subject $i$ in group $j$ at time $t$ is modeled using coefficients $\delta, \gamma$ and $\tau$, which are collectively known as the random parameters or coefficients, and which are generally denoted by $\beta$.

An LMEM can be defined as:
