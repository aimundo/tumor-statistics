# General Comments


# Comments from reviewers
## Missing data

The title for Section 3.4 has been changed from "Missing observations" to "Unbalanced data". We have restructured this section in order to:

- Avoid confusion by using the term "missing data". We now refer to different number of observations as "unbalanced data" (L201-204).

- Make clear that LMEMs also can work with missing observations (L209)

- Emphasize that GAMs are not immune to missing data problems (L217-220)


## Unnecesary restriction of LMMs


## GLMMs


## GLMs, GAMs, and conditional distributions

## Thin plate regression splines

The following changes have been made:

- L297-300 no longer refer to "knots" when referring to the construction of the smooth, now indicating that the number of _basis functions_ is what is specified when working with thin plate regression splines (TPRS), in the updated manuscript this appears in L310-315.


## Penalised splines

## Bayesian




## Coverage of confidence intervals


## Differences in smooths


## Appendix
