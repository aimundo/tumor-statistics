      Abstract = {{. We study the coverage properties of Bayesian confidence intervals for
         the smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs)
         represented using any penalized regression spline approach. The
         intervals are the usual generalization of the intervals first proposed
         by Wahba and Silverman in 1983 and 1985, respectively, to the GAM
         component context. We present simulation evidence showing these
         intervals have close to nominal across-the-function frequentist coverage
         probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane
         function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for
         univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical
         argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be
         achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias
         is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The
         theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a
         purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the
         neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval
         performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for
         component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the
         GAM identifiability constraints.}},
