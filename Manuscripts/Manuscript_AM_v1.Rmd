## Paper outline
 <span style="color: red;">I have been thinking that this type of paper probably does not need a relatively long introduction as the one I did for $JBO$. Below are some of my ideas on how to tackle this paper, your comments would be appreciated. Please keep in mind that I have started to write the Background/Intro part, and just have ideas on how to go from there</span>






## Background


The study of the temporal changes in a variable of interest (a longitudinal analysis) presents advantages over a cross-sectional study as it reduces the number of subjects required to achieve a certain statistical power[@guo2013], it enables a time-correlated view of the phenomenon of interest, and allows to explore multiple relationships between different variables. Typically, measurements are taken across multiple timepoints on the same subjects within  different group(s). Examples of this type of approach in biomedical research include clinical studies on breast and neck cancer[@sio2016;@kamstra2015], tumor response[@roblyer2011;@tank2020;@pavlov2018;@demidov2018], antibody expression[@ritter2001;@roth2017], and cell metabolism[@jones2018;@skala2010].

Researchers typically employ a $frequentist$ approach to analyze longitudinal data. Such type of analysis is a hypothesis test using the _analysis of variance over repeated measures_ (repeated measures ANOVA or rm-ANOVA). Although the usual approach, rm-ANOVA assumes that the data fulfills certain requisites: Constant variance across measurements (which is frequently unjustified) and  complete observations from each subject [@schober2018;@gueorguieva2004]. Moreover, this approach restricts the inferences it can extract from a longitudinal study, particularly when the data does not follow a linear trend (Figure 1. with line and "wiggly plot"), due to the inherent nature of the model and its limitations .Examples of such type of data are found in studies of tumor response to radio/chemotherapy in multiple models and clinical settings [@vishwanath2009]. Therefore, this study has three goals: a) Present in an amenable and practical manner the requisites  of a $frequentist$ approach over longitudinal data and how these limit the analysis b) present a different area of statistical analysis for longitudinal biomedical data _Bayesian Statistics_, which does not use *p-values*, and is less restrictive thereby allowing  a statical analysis that is based on the data itself. c)Iimplement b) over a set of simulated data that matches previously reported trends in longitudinal biomedical studies. With an emphasis on reproducibility by providing the code and dataset used, this will provide biomedical researchers a clear view of the advantages of Bayesian statistics for the analysis of longitudinal data.

* Paragraph 3: Bayesian statistics as an alternative approach. Advantages over ANOVA and what inference can be made from it. Argue that while it is not commonly used in the biomedical arena, this paper aims at showing the implementation in an amenable manner to analyze non-linear trends in data.
