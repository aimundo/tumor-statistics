## Background

A longitudinal study is defined as one where a variable of interest is measured repeatedly in a group (or groups) of subjects. In biomedical research, this type of study is preferred when the intention is to observe the evolution of the effect of treatment across time, rather than analyzing the information at a single timepoint (a cross-sectional study). Clinical examples of this  approach in biomedical research include studies on breast and neck cancer[@sio2016;@kamstra2015]; in the first case, weekly measurements of skin toxicities in  patients with radiation-induced dermatitis were taken for up to 8 weeks; whereas in the latter mouth opening measured was assessed at 6,12, 18, 24 and 36 months after radiotherapy (RT). Longitudinal studies have used also to measure tumor response [@roblyer2011;@tank2020;@pavlov2018;@demidov2018], antibody expression[@ritter2001;@roth2017], and cell metabolism[@jones2018;@skala2010]. From a statistical standpoint, a longitudinal study presents advantages over a cross-sectional approach:it requires a lower number of subjects to reach a certain statistical power, and besides it being able to track the previously mentioned time-effect evolution on a group-by-group basis, it allows to determine the variability of the response within subjects [@guo2013; @fitzmaurice2012]. In other words,a longitudinal study permits to quantify how the variable changes within each subject across time.

Researchers have typically employed a _frequentist_ approach to analyze longitudinal data, a statistical view that derives its name from the fact that it regards probability as a limiting frequency [wagenmakers2008]. when applied to longitudinal, a frequentist analysis is  based on a null hypothesis test using the _analysis of variance over repeated measures_ (repeated measures ANOVA or rm-ANOVA). This methodology makes two key assumptions regarding longitudinal data: a constant correlation across same-subject measurements and  complete observations from each subject [@schober2018;@gueorguieva2004]. The first condition is frequently unjustified  as  the correlation between measures diminishes when the time gap between them increases [@ugrinowitsch2004], and in that case violating that assumption increases the type I error rate[@lane2016]. The reasons behind the second assumption being not met in biomedical research are varied: subjects can withdraw during the course of the study, attrition in animals due to injury or weight loss, or complications can arise that prevent the researcher from collecting measurements at a certain timepoint. When these issues arise, rm-ANOVA requires to exclude the subject with missing observations from the analysis, which can lead to increased costs for the study if the desired statistical power is not met with the remaining subjects, and can lead to the exclusion of valuable information.Additionaly, rm-ANOVA uses a _post hoc_ analysis to assess significance in the differences between groups. Because a _post hoc_ analysis is based in multiple repeated comparisons, it can inflate the false positivity rate[@liu2010]. 

Recently, _linear mixed effects models_ (LMEMs) have been used by certain groups to analyze biomedical longitudinal data [@vishwanath2009;@skala2010]. Briefly, these models incorporate _fixed_ effects, which correspond to the levels of experimental factors in the study (e.g. the different drug regimens in a clinical trial), and _random_ effects, which account for random variation within the population [@pinheiro2006]. These models are more flexible than rm-ANOVA as they can accomodate missing observations in the data, and  allow to model the covariance of the parameters in different manners[@west2014]. On the other hand, they impose restrictions in the distribution of the errors and of the random effects, and assume linearity between the response and the parameters[@schielzeth2020;@pinheiro2006]. 

Additionaly, the inherent nature of both LMEMs and rm-ANOVA restrict the inferences they can extract from a longitudinal study when the data does not follow a linear trend, because the model in both cases does not provide consistent fit with the trend of the data. This particular non-linear behavior is exemplified in longitudinal studies that measure tumor response to radio/chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical settings  [@vishwanath2009; @roblyer2011;@tank2020;@skala2010;@demidov2018], and wound healing and metabolism[@jones2018;@grice2010;@young1994]. In such circumstances, it is even possible to obtain a "significant" _p-value_( _p_<0.05) due to the well-known variability of this metric [@nuzzo2014;@halsey2019], but the model will lack predictive power and this in turn will compromise the extent of the inferences that can be derived. 

In contrast to rm-ANOVA and LMEMs, _Bayesian statistics_ represent a relatively new field that does not rely on _p-values_ and hypothesis tests to analyze information. Bayesian statistics can work with missing observations, allow the data (and not an underlying assumed distribution) to determine the outcome in regard to significance and are able to expand the comparisons and inferences derived form the analysis. On the other hand, the shift that Bayesian theory represents from the traditional statistical view in research and the set of computational tools required for the implementation of this type of models have limited their use in the biomedical research community. Based on this, the goals of this study are: a) to present the limitations of a _frequentist_ approach (rm-ANOVA) over longitudinal data, and demonstrate how these limitations in turn affect the results of the analysis b) introduce in a practical and amenable manner the theory of Bayesian statistics highlighting its applicability to biomedical research and c)Implement b) over a set of simulated data that matches previously reported trends in longitudinal biomedical studies. With an emphasis on reproducibility by providing the code and dataset used, this will provide biomedical researchers a clear view of the advantages of Bayesian statistics for the analysis of longitudinal data.

Missing observations, and correlation between measurements. How rm-ANOVA is limited by missing observations, and how both rm-ANOVA and LMEMs are limited with data that does not follow a linear trend (equations for both situations and the fit they produce.)

* Section 2: Bayesian statistics as an alternative approach. Gentle presentation of Bayes theorem _with a biomedical-related example(!)_ Advantages over ANOVA and how inference works. Argue that while it is not commonly used in the biomedical arena, it is a more accurate and flexible approach.
