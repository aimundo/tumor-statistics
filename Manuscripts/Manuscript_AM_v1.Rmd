## Paper outline
 <span style="color: red;">I have been thinking that this type of paper probably does not need a relatively long introduction as the one I did for $JBO$. Below are some of my ideas on how to tackle this paper, your comments would be appreciated. Please keep in mind that I have started to write the Background/Intro part, and just have ideas on how to go from there</span>





Background/Introduction
Background
==============================================================


The study of the temporal changes in a variable of interest (a longitudinal analysis) is a question that has been analyzed extensively in biomedical research. Typically, measurements are taken across multiple timepoints on the same subject(s) within a group.  Examples of this type of approach include clinical studies on cancer breast and neck cancer[@sio2016;@kamstra2015], tumor response[@roblyer2011;@tank2020;@pavlov2018;@demidov2018], antibody expression[@ritter2001;@roth2017], and cell metabolism[@jones2018;@skala2010]. Whereas this type of study presents advantages over a cross-sectional study in the number of subjects required to achieve a certain statistical power, its ability to provide a time-correlated view of the phenomenon of interest, and, the potential to explore multiple relationships between different variables, the statistical analysis of such data is more challenging and requires careful consideration.

Biomedical researchers typically employ a $frequentist$ approach to analyze longitudinal data. Such type of analysis is a hypothesis test using the $analysis of variance over repeated measures$ (repeated measures ANOVA or rm-ANOVA). Although the usual approach, rm-ANOVA is subject to multiple conditions to be valid, some of which are not easily verifiable. Moreover, this approach restricts the inferences it can extract from a longitudinal study, particularly when the data does not follow a linear trend (Figure 1. with line and "wiggly plot"), due to the inherent nature of the model and its limitations .Examples of such type of data are found in studies of tumor response to radio/chemotherapy in multiple models and clinical settings [[@vishwanath2009]]. Therefore, this study has three goals: a) Present in an amenable and practical manner the requisities  of a $frequentist$ approach over longitudinal data and how these limit the analysis b) present a different area of statistical analysis for longitudinal biomedical data $Bayesian Statistics$, which does not use *p-values*, and is less restrictive thereby allowing  a statical analysis that is based on the data itself. c)Iimplement b) over a set of simulated data that matches previously reported trends in longitudinal biomedical studies. With an emphasis on reproducibility by providing the code and dataset used, this will provide biomedical researchers a clear view of the advantages of Bayesian statistics for the analysis of longitudinal data.

 

* Paragraph 2: Challenges presented by longitudinal studies. Missing observations, and correlation between measurements. Limitations that these items raise for the traditional ANOVA methods of analysis.

* Paragraph 3: Bayesian statistics as an alternative approach. Advantages over ANOVA and what inference can be made from it. Argue that while it is not commonly used in the biomedical arena, this paper aims at showing the implementation in an amenable manner to analyze non-linear trends in data.
