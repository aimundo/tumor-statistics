# Abstract

In biomedical research, the outcome of longitudinal studies has been traditionally analyzed using the _repeated measures analysis of variance_ (rm-ANOVA) or more recently, _linear mixed models_ (LMEMs). Although LMEMs are less restrictive than rm-ANOVA in terms of assumptions about imbalanced observations and correlation between observations, both methodologies assume a linear trend in the measured response. It is common in biomedical research that the true trend response is nonlinear and in these cases the linearity assumption of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs can lead to biased estimates and unreliable inference.

In contrast, generalized additive models (GAMs) relax the assumptions made by LMEMs and rm-ANOVA, and allow the data to determine the fit of the model while permitting missing observations and different correlation structures. Therefore, GAMs present an excellent choice to analyze longitudinal data with non-linear trends in the context of biomedical research. This paper summarizes the limitations of rm-ANOVA and LMEMs and uses simulated data to visually show how both methods produce biased estimates when used on non-linear data. We present the basic theory of GAMs and using reported trends of oxygen saturation in tumors, we simulate example longitudinal data (2 treatment groups, 10 subjects per group, 5 repeated measures for each group) to demonstrate their implementation in R. We also show that GAMs are able to produce estimates that are consistent with the trends of non-linear data even in the case when missing observations exist (with 40% of the simulated observations missing). To make this work reproducible, the code and data used in this paper are available at: https://github.com/aimundo/GAMs-biomedical-research.

#this function will remove the default "author information" that is the Pandoc LaTeX template. Otherwise, and additional "and" will appear at the end of the author list.Or, the custom template that is in the YAML header and that has the "author" line deleted may be used as well. An explanation in detail is provided at:

remove_author <- function(x) {
  # identify empty author line
  i <- grep("^\\\\author\\{\\}$", x)
  # be sure it is the one pandoc inserts
